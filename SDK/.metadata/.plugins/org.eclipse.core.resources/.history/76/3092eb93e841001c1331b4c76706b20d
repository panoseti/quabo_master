 *	Description:
 *	This is used for HS-PH mode.
 *	In HS-PH mode, we have three dual-port RAMs, so we need to read/write from/to the three dual-port RAMS.
 *	A axi interface is used for completing the work.

//			         1-Cache mode. Microblaze core will read data from the cache ram. RT part will stop working.
